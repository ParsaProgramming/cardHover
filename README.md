## Features 
- if you hover on the cards the *::before* item gets full-width and the other element have a change in their color and the design. for instance, the first item on the top from right.
- you will see a beautiful responsive design if you keep decreasing the window size. Therefore, this project is responsive too.

**I hope you will enjoy this project.**
